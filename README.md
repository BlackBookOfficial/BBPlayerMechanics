# BBPlayerMechanics ( Works with ESX )
Simple script i put together to tackle down on majority of wanted functions.
It requires you to have mythic_notify for notification popups.

# What does it contain?
- Handsup ( Key = X )
- Crouch ( Key = Left CTRL )
- Movement:
  . Health
  . Stamina
  . Hurt movement
  . Camera effects
  . Pointing
 - Disable car radio + hud

# Requirements:
https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_notify

# Conflicted potentials:
Remove any other scripts that conflict with my script:
Handsup mechanics on keys.
Crouch mechanics on keys.
Camera effects when hurt.

# If you find any bugs please report them in issues!
# If you have a pull request. Please send them and i will look at it!
# Enjoy the script!
